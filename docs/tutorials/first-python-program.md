# Your First Python Program

Learn the basics of Python programming by building your first interactive program step by step.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Setting up a Python development environment
- Understanding variables and data types
- Working with user input and output
- Writing your first interactive program

## ⏱️ Time Required

Approximately 30-45 minutes

## 📋 Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience required
- Python 3.8 or later installed
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Verify Python Installation

First, let's make sure Python is properly installed on your system:

```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

You should see output like `Python 3.11.0` or similar.

### Step 2: Create Your Project Directory

```bash
mkdir my-first-python-program
cd my-first-python-program
```

### Step 3: Create Your First Python File

Create a new file called `hello.py`:

```python
# hello.py - My first Python program

print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to programming!")
```

Run your program:

```bash
python hello.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hello, World!
Welcome to programming!
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You just ran your first Python program!

## 📚 Understanding the Basics

### Variables and Data Types

Let's explore how to store and use data in Python:

```python
# hello_user.py - Working with variables

# String variables
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello"

# Number variables
age = 25
temperature = 98.6

# Boolean variables
is_student = True
has_pet = False

# Using variables
print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")
print("You are", age, "years old")
print("Temperature:", temperature, "°F")
print("Are you a student?", is_student)
```

### Getting User Input

Make your program interactive by asking for user input:

```python
# interactive_hello.py - Getting user input

# Ask for user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Ask for user's age
age_input = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age_input)  # Convert string to number

# Ask for favorite color
color = input("What's your favorite color? ")

# Create personalized greeting
print("\n" + "="*40)
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Your favorite color is {color}.")
print("="*40)
```

### Adding Logic with Conditionals

Make your program smarter by adding decision-making:

```python
# smart_greeting.py - Adding conditionals

name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

print(f"\nHello, {name}!")

# Age-based responses
if age < 13:
    print("You're just a kid! Enjoy being young!")
elif age < 20:
    print("Teenage years are exciting!")
elif age < 65:
    print("You're in the prime of your life!")
else:
    print("Wisdom comes with age!")

# Ask about hobbies
hobby = input("\nWhat's one of your hobbies? ")
print(f"That's cool! {hobby} sounds like fun.")

# Simple hobby responses
if "read" in hobby.lower():
    print("Reading is a great way to learn new things!")
elif "music" in hobby.lower():
    print("Music is the language of the soul!")
elif "sport" in hobby.lower() or "game" in hobby.lower():
    print("Staying active is important for health!")
else:
    print("It's great to have hobbies that make you happy!")
```

## 🏗️ Building a Complete Program

Let's combine everything we've learned into a more complete program:

```python
# personal_assistant.py - A simple personal assistant

import datetime

def main():
    print("🤖 Personal Assistant v1.0")
    print("=" * 30)
    
    # Get user information
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))
    
    # Current time
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    hour = now.hour
    
    # Time-based greeting
    if hour < 12:
        time_greeting = "Good morning"
    elif hour < 18:
        time_greeting = "Good afternoon"
    else:
        time_greeting = "Good evening"
    
    print(f"\n{time_greeting}, {name}!")
    
    # Age category
    if age < 18:
        print("You're young and have so much ahead of you!")
    elif age < 30:
        print("These are exciting years for growth and discovery!")
    elif age < 50:
        print("You're in a great phase of life!")
    else:
        print("Experience is a wonderful teacher!")
    
    # Simple calculator feature
    print("\n📊 Let me help you with a quick calculation:")
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
        operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")
        num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
        
        if operation == "+":
            result = num1 + num2
        elif operation == "-":
            result = num1 - num2
        elif operation == "*":
            result = num1 * num2
        elif operation == "/":
            if num2 != 0:
                result = num1 / num2
            else:
                print("Cannot divide by zero!")
                return
        else:
            print("Invalid operation!")
            return
        
        print(f"Result: {num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}")
        
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter valid numbers!")
    
    print(f"\nThanks for using the assistant, {name}! Have a great day! 🌟")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
