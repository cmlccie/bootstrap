# Bootstrap Coding Skills

Welcome to **Bootstrap Coding Skills** - a learning resource designed specifically for new developers who are just starting their coding journey.

## üéØ Our Mission

This site provides simple, minimal, and concise instructions to help you get started with essential development tools and languages. Our goal is to give you a solid foundation of the basics, help you become minimally productive quickly, and then point you toward resources for continued learning.

!!! note "Learning Philosophy"
These guides are intentionally basic and focused on getting you started. Think of them as a "bootstrap" - they'll help you take your first steps, but you'll want to continue learning from more comprehensive resources as you grow.
