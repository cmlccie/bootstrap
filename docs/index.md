# Bootstrap

A learning resource designed to help people get started coding.

!!! info "Definition"

    Bootstrap (in computer science) generally refers to the process of starting a system or program with minimal initial code, which then loads or constructs more complex systems. It‚Äôs foundational to both hardware (booting up a system) and software (compiling, building, or initializing systems).

Here we _bootstrap understanding_ by starting with minimal core concepts that prepare you with a solid foundation for more advanced learning - then point you to additional resources to continue your journey.

## üß† Method

When learning a new language or tool, you need four things:

1. To understand _what_ it does and _how_ it is _used_.
2. A functional development environment.
3. To learn the syntax.
4. Problems to solve.

Of course there is more to learn to become proficient, and, we'll provide links to resources where you can continue learning. Working through these four activities will _bootstrap_ your understanding and get you start working with new tech.

## üóíÔ∏è Note from the Author

I have gone through this process myself countless times - every time I approach learning a new language or learning some new technology! I have found from both my own experience and observing the experiences of others that those who invest time in developing solid foundations understanding the roots and basics of the technologies they employ, go farther and faster than those who only obtain a superficial understanding of high-level concepts. Dive deep - as deep as you need to connect what you are learning to what you already know.

Invest time to complete your understanding. If you don't know how something works, find out. Have questions? Get answers. When you are satisfied that you could comfortably explain how something works to someone else using your own words and language, then you can probably move on to the next thing you want to understand and employ. Repeat.

!!! quote "Chris Lunsford"

    "Things are only complicated until they are understood, then they are simple."

## üöÄ Ready to Begin?

There is a [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page for that. üòè Then, choose one of the bootstraps (e.g. Git, Java, etc.) to dive in.

There are also some general resources, here (see the left navigation bar) to help you as you continue your learning.
