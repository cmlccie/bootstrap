# Interactive Git Learning

Before diving into command-line Git, it's helpful to understand how Git works conceptually. The best way to learn this is through visual, interactive exercises.

## Learn Git Branching

[learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) is an excellent interactive tutorial that teaches Git concepts through visual exercises.

### Why Start Here?

- **Visual Learning**: See exactly what happens when you run Git commands
- **Hands-on Practice**: Try commands in a safe, interactive environment
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Learn how commits, branches, and merges work
- **No Setup Required**: Works directly in your web browser

### What You'll Learn

The interactive tutorial covers:

1. **Basic Git Commands** - commit, branch, merge
2. **Branching Concepts** - How branches work and why they're useful
3. **Merging Strategies** - Different ways to combine changes
4. **Remote Repositories** - Working with code stored on other computers

### Recommended Lessons

Complete these lessons from the interactive tutorial:

#### Introduction Sequence

1. **Introduction to Git Commits** - Understanding what a commit is
2. **Branching in Git** - Creating and switching between branches
3. **Merging in Git** - Combining changes from different branches
4. **Rebase Introduction** - An alternative to merging

#### Remote Repositories

1. **Clone Intro** - Copying repositories from remote servers
2. **Remote Branches** - Understanding how remote tracking works
3. **Git Fetch** - Downloading changes without applying them
4. **Git Pull** - Downloading and applying changes

### Time Investment

Plan to spend about 30-60 minutes working through these exercises. Take your time and don't worry if some concepts don't click immediately - you'll practice them with real commands in the next lessons.

### Getting Started

1. Visit [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
2. Click "Start" to begin the tutorial
3. Work through the Introduction Sequence lessons
4. Continue with the Remote Repository lessons
5. Feel free to explore additional lessons if you're curious!

## Key Concepts to Remember

After completing the interactive tutorial, you should understand:

- **Commits**: Snapshots of your code at specific points in time
- **Branches**: Independent lines of development
- **Merging**: Combining changes from different branches
- **Remote Repositories**: Code stored on other computers (like GitHub)

## What's Next?

Once you've completed the interactive tutorial and feel comfortable with these concepts, you're ready to start using Git from the command line.
