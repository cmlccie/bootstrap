# Git - Version Control Fundamentals

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code and collaborate with others. Think of it as a "save system" for your projects that lets you see what changed, when it changed, and who changed it.

## Why Learn Git?

- **Track Changes**: See exactly what changed in your code over time
- **Backup**: Never lose your work - everything is saved in the repository
- **Collaboration**: Work on projects with other people without conflicts
- **Industry Standard**: Every professional developer uses version control
