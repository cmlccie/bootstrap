#### Other Good Options

- **IntelliJ IDEA Community** - Excellent for Java development
- **Sublime Text** - Lightweight and fast
- **Atom** - Similar to VS Code

### 2. Terminal/Command Line

Learn basic command line navigation:

=== "macOS/Linux"

    ```bash
    # Navigate directories
    pwd                 # Show current directory
    ls                  # List files and directories
    cd dirname          # Change to directory
    cd ..               # Go up one level

    # Create and manage files
    mkdir newdirectory  # Create new directory
    touch newfile.txt   # Create new file
    rm filename.txt     # Delete file
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```cmd
    # Navigate directories
    cd                  # Show current directory
    dir                 # List files and directories
    cd dirname          # Change to directory
    cd ..               # Go up one level

    # Create and manage files
    mkdir newdirectory  # Create new directory
    copy nul newfile.txt # Create new file
    del filename.txt    # Delete file
    ```

### 3. Web Browser with Developer Tools

- **Chrome** or **Firefox** with developer tools
- Learn to open developer console (F12)
- Useful for debugging and learning

## üìö Learning Path Overview

We recommend learning in this order:

### Phase 1: Version Control with Git

**Why start here?**

- Essential for any programming work
- Helps you track and save your progress
- Industry standard tool every developer uses

**What you'll learn:**

- How to track changes in your code
- Basic Git commands for daily work
- How to handle conflicts when working with others

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours total

### Phase 2: Programming with Java

**Why Java?**

- Beginner-friendly syntax
- Widely used in industry
- Strong typing helps catch errors early
- Excellent learning resources available

**What you'll learn:**

- Basic programming concepts
- How to write and run Java programs
- Working with data and collections
- Writing clean, professional code

**Time investment:** 6-8 hours total

[Continue with Java ‚Üí](java/index.md)

## üöÄ Before You Begin

### Set Up Your Learning Environment

1.  **Create a dedicated workspace:**

        mkdir coding-bootstrap
        cd coding-bootstrap

2.  **Create directories for each topic:**

        mkdir git-practice
        mkdir java-projects

3.  **Open your code editor** in this directory

### Learning Tips

- **Take notes** - Write down important concepts
- **Practice regularly** - Even 30 minutes daily helps
- **Don't rush** - Understanding is more important than speed
- **Test everything** - Run code examples yourself
- **Make mistakes** - They're part of learning!

### When You Get Stuck

1. **Read error messages carefully** - They often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check the Quick Reference** sections for syntax reminders
3. **Search online** - Stack Overflow and official documentation are valuable
4. **Take breaks** - Sometimes stepping away helps clarify problems
5. **Practice patience** - Every professional developer was once a beginner

## üéØ Success Metrics

After completing both learning paths, you should be able to:

### Git Skills

- ‚úÖ Create and manage Git repositories
- ‚úÖ Track changes with commits
- ‚úÖ Handle basic merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Use .gitignore effectively

### Java Skills
