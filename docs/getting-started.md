# Getting Started

Welcome to Bootstrap! This guide will help you set up your development environment and choose the right learning path for your coding journey.

## üéØ Prerequisites

Before diving in, consider your current experience level:

- **Complete Beginner**: No prior programming experience
- **Some Experience**: Familiar with basic concepts but want to strengthen fundamentals
- **Switching Languages/Frameworks**: Experienced in one area, expanding to others

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup

### Essential Tools

1.  **Code Editor**

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
    - [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
    - [Vim/Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

2.  **Version Control**

    ```bash
    # Install Git
    git --version

    # Configure Git (first time setup)
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```

3.  **Programming Language Setup**

    === "Python"
    ```bash # Install Python (3.8+)
    python --version

        # Install package manager
        pip install --upgrade pip

        # Create virtual environment
        python -m venv myproject
        source myproject/bin/activate  # On Windows: myproject\Scripts\activate
        ```

    === "JavaScript/Node.js"
    ```bash # Install Node.js
    node --version
    npm --version

        # Alternative: use Node Version Manager
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
        nvm install node
        ```

    === "Other Languages"
    Check the specific installation guides for your chosen language: - [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) - [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) - [Java](https://adoptium.net/)

- **Sunday**: Review and planning (30 minutes)
```

## üéØ Setting Up Your First Project

1. **Create a project directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir my-coding-journey
   cd my-coding-journey
   ```

2. **Initialize version control**

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Create a README**

   ```bash
   echo "# My Coding Journey" > README.md
   ```

4. **Start coding!**
   - Follow along with tutorials
   - Experiment with examples
   - Build small projects
