## ‚ùì Why do this?

When you are learning a new language or working with a new tech stack, you need problems to solve. Some problem, to which, you can apply the technology and your understanding - this creates practical and active learning.

Some sites provide extensive tutorials. For me, I will learn _something_ from being spoon fed (walked through) building some illustrative example project. However, _**I will more**_ from being given a problem to solve and then going to work to build a functional solution. This active learning process forces me to ask and answer meaningful questions and learn more than just the lesson material the tutorial author created:

- How do I start a new project using this tech stack?
- How should the project be structured?
- Where are the docs? How good are they?
- How do I build the project?
- What artifacts are created?
- How do I deploy the project?

I start (and abandon!) new projects all the time. Repeating this active problem solving / project creation process over and over creates muscle memory. You'll begin to see patterns emerge in your processes. You'll find tools and resources you love ‚ù£Ô∏è and some you loath üò°. When your goal is learning, every project doesn't need to be a complete and polished deliverable. Go as far as you need to satisfy what you want to learn, then stop. If you make it a habit of checking your code into code repositories, you can always come back to where you left off and go further to continue learning.
